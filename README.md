# Parksystem


The City of Vence has requested your help in implementing a new parking garage. The garage will support different types of vehicles: cars and motorcycles. Each vehicle has a unique ID (the license plate) and can only exist once. The parking garage is intended to support multiple parquet floors, and the application should be able to keep the number of floors flexible. The number of parking spaces per floor should also be flexible and configurable since the site for the construction of the parking garage has not yet been found.

Your task is to develop a simulation program for the parking garage. The program should enable vehicles to enter and leave the parking garage. When a vehicle enters, the application should assign a free space to the vehicle, or reject it if there are no available parking spaces.

The manager of the parking garage should be able to ask the system for the position of a specific vehicle. The answer should include both the floor and the assigned parking space. Additionally, the program should be able to query the number of parking spaces that are still available.

Functionality
The Parking Garage Simulation Program has the following functionalities:

* Ability to add and remove vehicles (cars and motorcycles) with unique ID (license plate)
* Parking space assignment for vehicles entering the garage
* Rejecting vehicles if there are no available parking spaces
* Ability to query the position of a specific vehicle (floor and parking space)
* Query the number of available parking spaces

Please note that the username for the login is "username" and the password is "password123".
