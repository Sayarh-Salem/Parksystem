# Parking Garage Simulation Program


This simulation program was developed to assist the City of Vence in implementing a new parking garage that can support cars and motorcycles. Each vehicle has a unique ID (the license plate) and can only exist once, whether inside or outside the parking garage. The program has the ability to support multiple parquet floors, and the number of floors can be easily adjusted to meet the needs of the city. The number of parking spaces per floor is also configurable, as the site for the construction of the parking garage has not yet been finalized.

The program enables vehicles to enter and leave the parking garage. When a vehicle enters, the program assigns a free space to the vehicle, or rejects it if there are no available parking spaces. The manager of the parking garage has the ability to request the position of a specific vehicle and receive the assigned parking space and floor information. In addition, the program can query the number of parking spaces that are still available.
